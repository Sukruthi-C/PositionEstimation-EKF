# PositionEstimation-EKF
The project involved implementing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in MATLAB, specifically designed to enhance the estimation of satellite trajectories. This initiative was critical in addressing the challenges posed by the non-linear nature of satellite motion and the complexities inherent in its measurements.
